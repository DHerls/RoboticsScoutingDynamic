We zigged when we should have zagged
The computer monkeys got loose again
Demeo screwed it up
It wasn't me
I'm sorry, this usually never happens to me
Well anyways, here's Wonderwall
You touched something, I know you did
This is your fault
Survey says... You Broke It!
He's dead Jim
Some people are destined for greatness, others are you
If anyone asks, I've changed my name and moved to Mexico
