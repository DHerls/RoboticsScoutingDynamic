## The program is broken up in parts for each by two semicolons (;;) for the sake of readability. The program will not work for only one semicolon. Two are required.

## For elements {SEGMENTED_CONTROL, TEXTFIELD, STEPPER, LABEL}
## 		SEGMENTED_CONTROL args=[<Selection 1, Selection 2,Selection n>]
##			Format= SEGMENTED_CONTROL<args>;;[Title];;[Key]
##			For example, for a segmented control with options "Yes No Try/Fail" titled "Scored Goals" would look like
##			SEGMENTED_CONTROL <Yes,No,Try/Fail>;;Scored Goals;;teleop_scored_goals
##		TEXTFIELD args=[<keyboard type>] where type is any of the following... {decimal, number, normal}
##			Format= TEXTFIELD<args>;;[Title];;[Key]
##			For example, making a textfield with the title "Points Scored" would look like
##			TEXTFIELD;;Points Scored;;total_points_scored
##		STEPPER args=[<lower bound, upper bound>]
##			Format= STEPPER<args>;;[Title];;[Key]
##			For example a stepper that operated between bounds 0 and 5 inclusive titled "Boxes stacked" would look like
##			STEPPER <0,5>;;Boxed stacked;;teleop_boxes_stacked
##		LABEL args=[<type, justification>] where type is any of the following... {bold, normal, distinguished} and justification is {left, center, right}
##			Format= LABEL;;[Label Title]
##			For example a label titled "Autonomous" that is clear by drawing lines around it would look like the following
##			LABEL <distinguished>;;"Autonomous"
##		SWITCH args=[<Title 1, title 2, title n...>];;[<key 1, key 2, key n...>]
##			Format= SWITCH<args titles>;;<args keys>
##			For example a series of switchs with titles "Passes one", and "Passes two" would look like
##			SWITCH <Passes one, Passes two>;;<aut_passes1, aut_passes2>
##			There are a maximum of 6 switches in a single line.
